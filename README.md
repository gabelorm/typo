# Typo
This project was made during the course of [Web Dev]( http://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_spring_2018/) at Universidad de los Andes. With this app you will be able to have typing competitions with your friends. You can create a competition yourself or join an existing one, with as many players as you want! During the game, you will see in real time your performance as well as your friends'. You can keep track of your maximum speed across all games. Challenge yourself by playing games in different languages. This app was made with Meteor + React and is deployed [here](https://typo-go.herokuapp.com/), make sure to check it out. Feel free to explore the app yourself by following these steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/gabelorm/typo.git
